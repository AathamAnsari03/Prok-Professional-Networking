# Authentication Flow Fixes

This document outlines the comprehensive fixes implemented to resolve the authentication redirect issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Login Redirect Issue**
**Problem**: After successful login, users were being redirected to `/profile` instead of staying on the home page.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `Login.tsx` to redirect to `/` (home page) instead of `/profile`
- This provides a better user experience by taking users to the main application interface

### 2. **Unauthenticated Access to Protected Routes**
**Problem**: Users could access protected routes (profile, posts, jobs, messages) without being authenticated.

**Solution**:
- Created `ProtectedRoute.tsx` component to wrap all protected routes
- Added authentication checks with automatic redirect to login
- Implemented loading states during authentication checks

### 3. **Authenticated Users Accessing Auth Pages**
**Problem**: Logged-in users could still access login/signup pages.

**Solution**:
- Created `PublicRoute.tsx` component to redirect authenticated users away from auth pages
- Wrapped login, signup, and forgot-password routes with PublicRoute

### 4. **Home Page Authentication**
**Problem**: Home page was showing full app interface even for unauthenticated users.

**Solution**:
- Updated `HomePage.tsx` to include authentication checks
- Added proper loading states and redirects for unauthenticated users

## Components Created/Modified

### New Components
1. **`ProtectedRoute.tsx`**
   - Handles authentication for protected routes
   - Shows loading spinner during auth checks
   - Redirects to login if not authenticated

2. **`PublicRoute.tsx`**
   - Prevents authenticated users from accessing auth pages
   - Redirects to home if already logged in
   - Shows loading spinner during auth checks

### Modified Components
1. **`HomePage.tsx`**
   - Added authentication checks
   - Added loading states
   - Added automatic redirect for unauthenticated users

2. **`Login.tsx`**
   - Changed redirect destination from `/profile` to `/`
   - Improved user experience

3. **`routes/index.tsx`**
   - Wrapped protected routes with `ProtectedRoute`
   - Wrapped auth routes with `PublicRoute`
   - Improved route protection

## Authentication Flow

### For Unauthenticated Users:
1. Access any protected route → Redirected to `/login`
2. Access auth pages → Normal access allowed
3. Access home page → Redirected to `/login`

### For Authenticated Users:
1. Access protected routes → Normal access allowed
2. Access auth pages → Redirected to `/`
3. Access home page → Normal access allowed

### Login Process:
1. User enters credentials
2. Backend validates and returns token
3. Frontend stores token and user data
4. User is redirected to home page (`/`)
5. Home page loads with full application interface

## Testing

### Backend API Testing:
- ✅ User registration: `POST /api/auth/signup`
- ✅ User login: `POST /api/auth/login`
- ✅ Token validation working
- ✅ Password requirements enforced

### Frontend Testing:
- ✅ Authentication state management
- ✅ Route protection
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Redirect logic

## Test Credentials

For testing the application, you can use:
- **Username**: `testuser`
- **Email**: `test@example.com`
- **Password**: `TestPass123`

## Security Features

1. **Token-based Authentication**: JWT tokens stored in localStorage
2. **Route Protection**: All sensitive routes require authentication
3. **Automatic Redirects**: Users are automatically redirected based on auth status
4. **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during auth checks
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling for failed authentication

## Usage

### Starting the Application:
```bash
# Frontend (in app/frontend/)
npm run dev

# Backend (in app/backend/)
python main.py
```

### Access URLs:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:5000

### Testing the Flow:
1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. You should be redirected to login page
3. Use test credentials to log in
4. You should be redirected to home page with full interface
5. Try accessing `/profile`, `/posts`, etc. - should work
6. Try accessing `/login` while logged in - should redirect to home

## Benefits

- **Improved Security**: Proper route protection
- **Better UX**: Logical redirects and loading states
- **Consistent Behavior**: All routes follow the same auth patterns
- **Maintainable Code**: Reusable auth components
- **Error Prevention**: Users can't access inappropriate pages
