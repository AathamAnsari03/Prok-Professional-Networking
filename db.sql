### Database (Conceptual - SQLite with Flask-SQLAlchemy)

This section outlines the conceptual database schema for the Prok Professional Networking App, designed for a tutorial context. The primary focus is on fundamental data relationships, not production-level scaling or advanced optimizations.

**Technical Stack:**

* **Database System:** SQLite (for simplicity and ease of setup in a tutorial)
* **ORM (Object-Relational Mapper):** Flask-SQLAlchemy (Python)

**Conceptual Schema:**

Here are the proposed database tables and their key fields, along with relationships:

    * `email`: TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL - User's email address, also unique.
    * `password_hash`: TEXT NOT NULL - Hashed version of the user's password (for security, never store plain passwords).
