# Day 10: Advanced

## 🎯 Goal

Build the **Advanced** module of the Prok Professional Networking app. This module covers advanced features, optimizations, or integrations to enhance the application.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

- Understand advanced concepts in full-stack web development.
- Implement complex UI and backend features using React, Tailwind CSS, and Flask.
- Learn best practices for performance, security, and scalability.
- Integrate third-party APIs or advanced libraries as needed.

## 🛠️ Tasks

1. **Setup the Project**

   - Clone the repository and navigate to the `day10-advanced` folder.
   - Install frontend dependencies in the `frontend` directory:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install
     ```
   - Install backend dependencies in the `backend` directory:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Frontend Implementation**

   - Build advanced UI components or features using React and Tailwind CSS.
   - Integrate with advanced libraries or third-party APIs if required.
   - Optimize for performance and accessibility.

3. **Backend Implementation**

   - Create Flask API endpoints for advanced features.
   - Use models and services to interact with the database and external APIs.
   - Implement security, rate limiting, or other advanced backend features.

4. **Testing**
   - Test all advanced features end-to-end.
   - Ensure the UI and backend handle edge cases and errors gracefully.

## 🧪 Bonus Challenge

- Add an extra improvement, such as:
  - Integration with a third-party API (e.g., LinkedIn, Google Maps).
  - Performance optimization (e.g., caching, lazy loading).
  - Security enhancements (e.g., OAuth, 2FA).
- Document your improvement in your own words at the end of this README.

## ✅ Deliverable

A working advanced module with a clean UI and functional backend, pushed to GitHub in the `/final` folder.
