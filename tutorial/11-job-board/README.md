# Day 11: Job Board

## üéØ Goal

Implement the Job Board & Application UI (frontend) and corresponding backend API endpoints.

## üìö Learning Outcomes

- Create job listing interface
- Implement job search functionality
- Design job application system
- Create job filtering system
- Implement job recommendations
- Handle job application process

## üöÄ Getting Started

Ensure your Day 10 Navigation System is complete and tested. You should understand search algorithms and file handling. The backend and frontend should be set up and running.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tasks

### Create and Switch to a New Branch

> **IMPORTANT:** Always create a new branch for each distinct piece of work.

```bash
# First, ensure you are on your 'main' branch and it's up-to-date
git checkout main
git pull origin main  # Get any potential updates from your own fork's main

# Now, create and switch to a new branch for this day's assignment/feature
git checkout -b day-11-job-board
```

> **What's happening?** You're creating an independent line of development for this day's tasks.

### Set Up Development Environment

#### Backend Virtual Environment (if not already active):

```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### Install Additional Dependencies:

```bash
pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy Flask-Migrate python-dotenv
```

#### Frontend (already set up from previous days):

Ensure your frontend directory has all Node.js dependencies installed via `npm install`.

### Frontend Implementation

#### Create Job Board Components

- Design and implement job listing component
- Create job search functionality
- Add job filtering system
- Implement job details view
- Create application form
- Add job recommendations

### Backend Implementation

#### Set Up Job Management System

- Create job and application models
- Implement job listing endpoints
- Add search functionality
- Create application system
- Implement recommendation engine
- Add job analytics

### Application Process

#### Implement Job Application System

- Create comprehensive application form
- Implement file upload functionality
- Add progress tracking system
- Create status update mechanism
- Implement notification system
- Add application history tracking

### Run the Application

```bash
# Start the backend server (in one terminal)
cd backend
flask run

# Start the frontend development server (in another terminal)
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at:

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000/jobs
- Backend API: http://localhost:5000

### Testing

- Test job search functionality
- Test filtering system
- Test application process
- Test file uploads
- Test notifications
- Test recommendations

## üîÑ Git Workflow

### Develop and Save Your Progress

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Day 11: Implement job board and application system"
```

### Push Your Changes to Your Fork

```bash
git push -u origin day-11-job-board
```

### Merge After Completion

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge day-11-job-board
git push origin main
```
