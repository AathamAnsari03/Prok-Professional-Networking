# Day 7: Posts Listing

## üéØ Goal

Implement Posts Listing UI (frontend) and integrate with the backend API to fetch existing posts.

## üìö Learning Outcomes

- Create responsive post listing components
- Implement infinite scrolling
- Handle post data fetching
- Create post filtering system
- Implement post sorting
- Design efficient data loading

## üöÄ Getting Started

Ensure your Day 6 First Deployment is complete and tested. You should understand React hooks and API integration. The backend and frontend should be set up and running.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tasks

### Create and Switch to a New Branch

> **IMPORTANT:** Always create a new branch for each distinct piece of work.

```bash
# First, ensure you are on your 'main' branch and it's up-to-date
git checkout main
git pull origin main  # Get any potential updates from your own fork's main

# Now, create and switch to a new branch for this day's assignment/feature
git checkout -b day-7-posts-listing
```

> **What's happening?** You're creating an independent line of development for this day's tasks.

### Set Up Development Environment

#### Backend Virtual Environment (if not already active):

```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### Install Additional Dependencies:

```bash
pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy Flask-Migrate
```

#### Frontend (already set up from previous days):

Ensure your frontend directory has all Node.js dependencies installed via `npm install`.

### Frontend Implementation

#### Create Post List Component

- Design a responsive list for displaying posts
- Implement infinite scroll using a custom hook
- Add post filtering and sorting options
- Implement loading and error states

### Backend Integration

#### Create Post Listing Endpoints

- Implement GET /api/posts with pagination, filtering, and sorting
- Optimize queries for performance
- Add data caching for frequently accessed posts

### Performance Optimization

- Implement lazy loading for images and data
- Add request debouncing for filters and search
- Use virtual scrolling for large lists
- Optimize API calls and reduce re-renders

### Run the Application

```bash
# Start the backend server (in one terminal)
cd backend
flask run

# Start the frontend development server (in another terminal)
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at:

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000/posts
- Backend API: http://localhost:5000

### Testing

- Test infinite scroll with large data sets
- Test filtering and sorting functionality
- Test loading and error states
- Test performance and responsiveness

## üîÑ Git Workflow

### Develop and Save Your Progress

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Day 7: Implement posts listing UI and backend integration"
```

### Push Your Changes to Your Fork

```bash
git push -u origin day-7-posts-listing
```

### Merge After Completion

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge day-7-posts-listing
git push origin main
```
