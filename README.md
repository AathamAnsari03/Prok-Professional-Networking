## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Python (v3.8 or higher)
- Git
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)

To check your installed versions:

```bash
# Check Node.js version
node --version

# Check Python version
python --version
```

1.**Fork the Template Repository (Online - on GitHub/GitLab)**

   Go to the course template repository in your web browser:
   "https://github.com/AathamAnsari03/Prok-Professional-Networking.git"

   In the top-right corner of the repository page, click the "Fork" button.

   > **What is Forking?** This creates a personal copy of the entire template repository under your own GitHub/GitLab account. This copy is completely independent of the original course template. You have full control over your fork.

   If prompted, choose your personal account as the owner of the fork.

2.**Clone Your Fork to Your Local Machine**

   Now that you have your own copy online, let's bring it to your computer:

   - Go to your newly forked repository on GitHub/GitLab (it will be under your username)
   - Click the green "Code" button
   - Copy the URL (make sure it's the HTTPS URL, unless you've set up SSH keys)
   - Open your terminal and navigate to your desired directory
   - Run the following commands:

   ```bash
   # Clone your fork
   git clone <URL_of_YOUR_FORK>
   # Example: git clone https://github.com/your-username/prok-professional-networking.git

   # Change into the project directory
   cd prok-professional-networking
   ```

   > **What is Cloning?** This downloads a complete copy of your online fork to your local machine. This is your personal workspace for the course.

3. **Configure Your Git User Information (One-Time Setup)**

   This tells Git who you are when you make changes. If you've already done this for other projects on your computer, you can skip this step:

   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

   > **Note:** The `--global` flag sets your name and email for all Git projects on your computer.
